# 📈 Quant Trading & Portfolio COLLECTION

## 🚀 Overview

This repository serves as a research laboratory for **Quantitative Finance**, **Algorithmic Trading**, and **Portfolio Management**. The goal is to bridge the gap between complex mathematical theories (Stochastic Calculus, Black-Scholes) and practical implementation using modern software engineering and data science.

Each module focuses on a specific theory or strategy, debunking myths or validating concepts through **simulations** and **visualizations**.
