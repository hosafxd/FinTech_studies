    "\n",
    " After applying the necessary assumptions and hedge portfolio argument, the Black-Scholes equation is a partial differential equation as the randomness from the original stochastic differential equation is hedged away, this PDE describes how the value of a European-style option changes over time and must earn the risk-free rate in a no arbitrage risk-neutral world:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial t} + \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2S^2\\frac{\\partial^2 V}{\\partial S^2} + rS\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial S} - rV = 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    " where:\n",
    " - $V$ is the option value\n",
    " - $t$ is time\n",
    " - $S$ is the stock price\n",
    " - $r$ is the risk-free interest rate\n",
    " - $\\sigma$ is the volatility of the stock\n",

    " Notice $V(\\theta) \\mapsto \\mathbb{R} \\text{ where } \\theta = (t, S, r, K, \\sigma) \\in \\mathbb{R}^5$ - there is no visualizing this function but in the same sense as the multivariable function above we are looking to recover it from the PDE.\n",

    "\n",
    " - **Numerical Solution:** Finite-Differences (Direct PDE Method), Monte Carlo Simulation (Expectation of Derivative Contract) \n",

    "##### 6.) ⚔️ Analytical v. Numerical Solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "🔎 **Key Observations:**\n",
    "\n",
    "For a derivative whose payoff only depends on the terminal stock price distribution we don't have to simulate paths if the terminal distribution is directly available for Monte Carlo simulation of derivative prices.  We can simply sample from the terminal distribution for the model's framework (i.e. Black-Scholes framework means sampling from GBM Lognormal terminal price distribution), computing a discounted payoff, and averaging those discounted payoffs to determine the risk-neutral price.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1.) 🎯 Accuracy:**\n",
    "   - The analytical solution is exact (up to floating-point precision)\n",
    "   - Euler-Maruyama introduces discretization error that depends on step size\n",
    "   - The error becomes more pronounced for larger time steps or higher volatility\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.) ⏳ Computational Efficiency:**\n",
    "   - Analytical solution is generally faster as it requires fewer calculations\n",
    "   - Euler-Maruyama requires step-by-step calculations which can be slower\n",
    "   - However, Euler-Maruyama is more versatile for complex SDEs\n",
    "\n",
    "**3.) 📋 Implementation:**\n",
    "   - Analytical solution requires knowing the exact solution form\n",
    "   - Euler-Maruyama can be applied to any SDE, even when no analytical solution exists\n",
    "   - Euler-Maruyama is easier to modify for different drift and diffusion terms\n",
    "\n",
    "**4.) 🌊 Stability:**\n",
    "   - Analytical solution is inherently stable\n",
    "   - Euler-Maruyama can become unstable for large time steps\n",
    "   - Both methods preserve the positivity of stock prices"

    "See my video [What Does AI Actually Learn](https://youtu.be/tX7b2KT63WQ) and [How to Trade with Edge](https://youtu.be/NlqpDB2BhxE) for discussions on why this is the *best* we can do when randomness is prescribed and *is well defined* by some theoretical distribution that is *known* not some unseen unmeasured theoretical distribution.\n",
